# backfeed

The "backfeed" protocol is a public objective non-economic reputation system

It issues tokens to compensate "contributions" to "communities" as a function of "evaluations" made by reputed community members.

The token issuance mechanism is resistant to Sybil attack because a majority of reputation is required to participate for issuance to occur.

Reputation is (optionally) redistributed between evaluators based on their ability to predict future evaluations.

The reputation distribution mechanism is resistant to Sybil attacks so long as Sybil cannot predict the evaluations of non-Sybil commmunity members.
